What is recursion ?
--A process (a fucntion) that calls itself 
  JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() are recursive fucntion
  document.getElementById() and DOM traversal algorithms are writed recursively 
  It's sometime a cleaner alternative to iteration

What is Call Stack?
--It's a data structure called stack, 
  when a function is invocked it is placed on the top of the stack 
  when js sees the return key and when the func ends, the compiler will remove it
  when we write recursive fucntions we keep pushing new fucntion onto the call stack 
  The base case is the condition when the call stack ends
  important points to note are the base case and changing the parameters

Notes on the base case
--It mostly always contains a conditional paired up with a return statement

Common Pitfalls in reccursion
--You do not have a valid edge case or no base case 
  returning the wrong thing or nothing

Helper method Recursion
--compile some sort of result in an array or some sort of ds
  a fucntion is wrapped around a reccursive fucntion
