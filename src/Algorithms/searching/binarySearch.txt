Binary Search
--Is much faster form of search, works only for sorted arrays 
  Rather than eliminating one element at a time you can eliminate half 
  of the remaining elements at a time 

--It works on the principle of divide and conquer
  
--TIME COMPLEXITY 
  --worst and average case is O(log n) and best case is O(1){found in first iteration}
    if the number of elements is n then the number of iterations is log 2 n{base is 2}
    ex: if n=16 then no. of iterations is 4 if n is 32 then the number of iterations is 5
