--Rules For Max Binary Heap--

- Each parent has at most 2 child nodes, 
- The value of eachp parent node is always greater than its child node 
- In a max binary heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantee between sibling nodes 
- A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first.


useCases 
- Priority Queue
- They are also used in graph traversal algorithms
